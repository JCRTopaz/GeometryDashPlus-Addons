# GeometryDashPlus Addons

## Security Info
These Addons have been officially verified and added to the list of Verified Addons. You can still download other Addons, just download them at your own risk. I am not responsible for any damage to your PC, if it happens.

Also, if a malicious addon gets added to the list of verified addons (which is near impossible), please contact me via [Discord](https://www.discord.com): `TheRealCrast#3284`. I will rescan the uploaded addon, and take it down if any malicious content is inside.

## Verifying Your Addon
Verifying your addon is a simple step, yet must abide with the following requirements:

* No executable files are allowed (such as ``.exe``, ``.bat``, ``.cmd``, ``.vbs``, ``.jar``, ``.java``, ``.sys``, etc.)
* No inappropriate content
* Doesn't copy an existing addon

After you've corrected your mistakes, you can now request to verify your Addon by going to the [GD+ Addon Verification Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSct92OebFTNP2z0GErLsmhe66pSUHrlUv71dEt8SYJNFeE1EQ/viewform).
