# GeometryDashPlus Addons

## Security Info
These Addons have been officially verified and added to the list of Verified Addons. You can still download other Addons, just download them at your own risk. I am not responsible for any damage to your PC, if it happens. (and it would be harder to get the pack).

Also, if a malicious addon gets added to the list of verified addons (which is near impossible), please contact me via [Discord](https://www.discord.com): `TheRealCrast#0001`. I will rescan the uploaded addon, and take it down if any malicious content is inside.

## Verifying Your Addon
Verifying your addon is a simple step, yet must abide with the following requirements:

* No executable files are allowed (such as ``.exe``, ``.bat``, ``.cmd``, ``.vbs``, ``.jar``, ``.java``, ``.sys``, etc.)
* No inappropriate content
* Doesn't copy an existing addon
* For your safety, do not include ``.dat`` files.

After you've corrected your mistakes, you can now request to verify your Addon by going to the [GD+ Addon Verification Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSct92OebFTNP2z0GErLsmhe66pSUHrlUv71dEt8SYJNFeE1EQ/viewform). Note that it may take up to a week before it is launched. Don't worry, as it's usually around 24 hours.

## Addons
All addons are for Geometry Dash 2.11 as of now.

When the next version of GDPlus releases, you will be able to use the discovery tab to download addons.
